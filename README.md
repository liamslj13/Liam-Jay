# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Liam!

## About Me
I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Saint Mary's University in Nova Scotia, Canada. I enjoy looking into the architecture of programming languages, and recently have been diving deeper into topics such as operating systems, computational geometry, and competition maths. Occasionally I also create animations using the math animation engine ***Manim***. I will upload them to a public repository once I have enough compiled into a manageable folder.
<br /><br />
My friends and I are currently building a few projects together. We are working on creating games for release on Roblox using Lua, and for release on other platforms with the Godot 4 engine and GDScript. 
<br /><br />
I also enjoy natural languages and language acquisition. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to represent my university at a nationally at a competition for speakers of Japanese as a foreign language. I am currently an exchange student on a year abroad to Japan at Hiroshima University! Feel free to reach out to me via email [here](liam.jay@smu.ca), I would love to hear from you.
